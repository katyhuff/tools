Updates:

- Miltos Alamaniotis 
  - focus is on developing intelligent algorithms for analysis of gamma ray 
    spectra
  - 5-6 papers on these algorithms
  - chapter in a book using a new algorithm 
  - Lydia (student) presented at URI
    - developing data reduction algorithm that analyzes spectra using 1024 
      channels, was able to reduce the number of channels in the detector
    - the reducation is based on decompos
    - simulated the spectra that she needs (GADRAS code and MCNP
    - putting simulations into neural networks and develop appropriate 
  - Another student 
    - car mounted sensor measurements of west lafayette
    - student had to leave the program, but a new undergrad will continue that 
      work
- Chan Choi 
- Lefteri Tsoukalas 
  - new projects and algorithms for signal analysis 
  - prepare students with knowledge on signal processing
  - wavelets, fuzzy algorithms
- Bernard and Canek Fuentes-Hernandez 
  - photomultiplier tubes are bulky
  - thin organic semiconductors and films would improve on our ability to  
  - low dark currents
  - can perform extremely well as photodetectors 
  - flexible substrates over large areas, more economic
  - characterizing response time
  - learning about needs in radiation detection
  - focus in cnec is to try to understand what we will need to couple these 
    organic materials with conventional detectors.
  - key challenges recently has been the response time of the detectors, so an 
    accomplishemnts is the sub-milisecond time frame
  - next steps
    - test ruggedness in radiation field
    - incorporate thermally assisted ley florescence emitters
    - combining organic and plastic scintillators into plastic scintillators
    - considering potential applications with dosimetry
- Nolan Hertel 
  - Organic materials and devices - Develop large-area thin-film organic 
    photodetectors for netron detection and gamma-ray discrimintation 
    capabilities.
  - ZnO detectors - generate thermal neutron detects using solution grown zno 
    nanorods
  - SONEX-P assess use of neutron tubes from Airbus space and defense
- Rizwan Uddin 
  - VERL
  - Christian Zircher (video game environment)
- Rob Hayes 
  - used to do radiation worker dosimetry
  - implementation of dosimetry in the field, strategy for QA, these are within 
    Rob's expertise
  - gamma spectrometer in your mother's bathroom
  - gamma camera in kitchens everywhere
  - quartz, tile, porcelin can become a dosimeter 
  - an array of these items, one can image the source
  - slices can give spectral understanding as well
  - electron paramagnetic resonance (works well with organic materials)
  - TLR/SLO??? works well with inorganic materials
  - also does air monitoring -- new tools for discriminating anthropogenic 
    signals from natural
