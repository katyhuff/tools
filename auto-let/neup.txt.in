Dear {{ first }},

I am emailing today as the ANS student chapter faculty advisor to encourage you to apply to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy University Programs Undergraduate Scholarship.

Though I'm sure you are already planning to, I wanted to especially urge you to apply because your GPA is above the cutoff for NEUP I believe that with your high GPA (as well as your qualifyin citizenship), you will have a very good chance to win one.  These scholarships are an excellent source of extra cash in addition to being quite presitgous.

The applications opened December 12 and are due January 25. Instructions are at https://neup.inl.gov/Lists/Headlines/AnnouncementDispForm.aspx?ID=146 .

You will need:
- A Personal Career Goals essay
- Three reference letters (request these now!)
- Official undergraduate and any graduate college transcripts
- ACT (code 6309) or SAT (code 5965) scores

Official transcripts can be mailed to the following address:

NEUP Integration Office 
Attn: Jenna Payne 
P.O. Box 1625 
MS 3730 
Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3730  

I do hope you will consider applying and that you won't hesitate to let me know if you have questions about the process. 

Best, 
Katy
