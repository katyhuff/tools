Dear {{ first }},

I am emailing today as the UIUC ANS student section Faculty Advisor. 

Though I'm sure you are planning to already without lots of reminders from me, I wanted to especially urge you to apply for one of the national ANS scholarships.  I noticed that your GPA is high ({{ gpa }} according to the department's current records).  I believe that with your high GPA, you will have a very good chance to win one. These scholarships are prestigious and often are accompanied by a monetary award. 

The applications opened yesterday and will be due in February. Instructions are at http://www.ans.org/honors/scholarships/. You will need:


- Our Department Chair's address. 

James F. Stubbins
216 Talbot Laboratory MC 234
104 S. Wright Street
Urbana Illinois 61801
(217) 333-2295

- Your Transcript. (can be requested through Student Self Service). 

- Names and contact information for three references (such as professors or employers -- I would be happy to provide one since I know you). 

- A list of academic and ANS related groups in which you have participated

- A list of your honors and awards 

- A Personal Statement (500 words or less) of your future plans.

- A sponsorship letter from me, the UIUC ANS student chapter faculty advisor. 

I do hope you will consider applying and that you won't hesitate to let me know if you have questions about the process. 

Best, 
Katy
